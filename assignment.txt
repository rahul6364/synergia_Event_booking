Assignment 2

Extend your previous Node.js & Express Synergia Event Booking API by connecting it to MongoDB instead of using an in-memory array and implement CRUD APIs with querying features.


Objectives:

Connect Node.js and Express API to MongoDB
Perform CRUD operations on MongoDB

Implement filtering and search queries

Follow REST API standards

Requirements:

Initialize MongoDB connection using Mongoose / mongodb client

Create a Booking model with schema fields:

{
  name: String,
  email: String,
  event: String,
  ticketType: String,
  createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now }
}


All data must now be stored in MongoDB instead of an array.

Validate required fields: name, email, event.

Use proper status codes for responses.

No	HTTP Method	Endpoint	Description
1	GET	/api/bookings	Get all bookings
2	POST	/api/bookings	Create a new booking
3	GET	/api/bookings/:id	Get booking by ID
